# SmartFlow-Prep
SmartFlow-Prep is the data preprocessing pipeline for the SmartFlow system. It collects, cleans, and enriches historical CitiBike trip data with contextual features such as weather, time, holidays, and station metadata. The processed output serves as the structured input for SmartFlowâ€™s bike rebalancing model.
